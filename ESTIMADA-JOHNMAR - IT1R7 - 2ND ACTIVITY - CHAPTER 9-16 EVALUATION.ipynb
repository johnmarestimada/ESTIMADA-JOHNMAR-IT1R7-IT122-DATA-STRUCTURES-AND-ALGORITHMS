A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. Also, graphs are used to solve real-life problems that involve representation of the problem space as a network. Examples of networks include telephone networks, circuit networks, social networks like IG, Twitter, Facebook and etc. There are two types of graph, the Undirected graph and the directed graph. In an undirected graph, nodes are connected by edges that are all bidirectional. Individual entities or the object or subject are called nodes and the one that connect the nodes called edge. Another example of graph is flight routes, nodes are connected by directed edges and they only go in one direction. So, in other words the flight routes are a directed graph because it has a direction.  Graph and Tree is different because in a tree there’s only one path between two nodes while graph has many paths to connect to the nodes.\")"

So, what is binary search?  binary search is an advanced type of search algorithm that finds and fetches data from a sorted list of items. It works by dividing the array into half on every iteration under the required element is found. Its core working principle involves dividing the data in the list to half until the required value is located and displayed to the user in the search result. To find the number you want in an index or numbers, you will have to count how many numbers you have and write the index of it, and the index should start at the zero position. So, with that you will know where did your chosen number has placed.  Linear search is not efficient because if you have a lot of size of data it will take a long time before it will finish. Binary search is very important because it work efficiently on sorted data no matter what the size of the data or how big is the size of the data. Another is Instead of performing the search by going through the data in a sequence, the binary algorithm randomly accesses the data to find the required element. This makes the search cycles shorter and more accurate. So binary search is more efficient than the linear search. \")"

Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm which is used to sort a given set of n elements provided in form of an array with n number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the element one by one and sort them based on their values. If the given array has to be sorted in ascending order, then bubble sort will start by comparing the first element of the array with the second element, if the first element is greater than the second element, it will swap both the elements, and then move on to compare the second and the third element, and so on. Bubble Sort Algorithm is used to arrange N elements in ascending order, and for that, you have to begin with 0th element and compare it with the first element. If the 0th element is found greater than the 1st element, then the swapping operation will be performed, the two values will get interchanged. In this way, all the elements of the array get compared. Based on the given example, in an index number, the last number will be the highest number. So bubble sorting is all bout swapping the numbers lowest to highest.\")"

It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. It creates two empty arrays to hold elements less than the pivot value and elements greater than the pivot value, and then recursively sort the sub arrays. Quick sort is the fastest or quickness sort in algorithm. We can say it is the fastest because from the word itself quick it means fast.  Quick sort used as a better way of searching. It is used everywhere where a stable sort is not needed. Quicksort is a cache-friendly algorithm as it has a good locality of reference when used for arrays. The key process in quick sort is partition (). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements smaller than x before x, and put all greater elements greater than x after x. All this should be done in linear time.\")"

The array elements are compared with each other sequentially and then arranged simultaneously in some particular order. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array. An insertion sort compares values in turn, starting with the second value in the list. If this value is greater than the value to the left of it, no changes are made. Otherwise, this value is repeatedly moved left until it meets a value that is less than it. The sort process then starts again with the next value. The primary advantage of insertion sort over selection sort is that selection sort must always scan all remaining elements to find the absolute smallest element in the unsorted portion of the list, while insertion sort requires only a single comparison\")"

It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer. Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list. Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists. Merge Sort is a stable sort which means that the same element in an array maintain their original positions with respect to each other. Merge sort is one of the stable sorting method. So  how merge sort uses divide-and-conquer, first is Divide by finding the number qqq of the position midway between ppp and rrr. Do this step the same way we found the midpoint in binary search: add ppp and rrr, divide by 2, and round down. Second is Conquer by recursively sorting the subarrays in each of the two subproblems created by the divide step. That is, recursively sort the subarray array[p..q] and recursively sort the subarray array[q+1..r] third is Combine by merging the two sorted subarrays back into the single sorted subarray array[p..r]. Merge sort is more efficient and works faster than quick sort in case of larger array size or datasets.

Shell sort is a sorting algorithm that first sorts the elements far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted. It is a generalized version of insertion sort. In shell sort, elements at a specific interval are sorted. It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange or sorting by insertion. The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. Shell sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm avoids large shifts as in case of insertion sort, if the smaller value is to the far right and has to be moved to the far left. The shell sort algorithm extends the insertion sort algorithm and is very efficient in sorting widely unsorted arrays. The array is divided into sub-arrays and then insertion sort is applied. The algorithm is: Calculate the value of the gap. It improves on the insertion sort by breaking the original list into a number of smaller sublists, each of which is sorted using an insertion sort. The unique way that these sublists are chosen is the key to the shell sort.\")"

It has an O(n²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. The time complexity of the selection sort is the same in all cases. At every step, you have to find the minimum element and put it in the right place. The minimum element is not known until the end of the array is not reached. The disadvantage of selection sort is if the input size increases the performance or sorting or selection sort decreases but selection sort can be good at checking if everything is already sorted.

Recursion is the process of defining a problem or the solution to a problem in terms of a simpler version of itself. Recursion is a method of solving problems where you solve smaller portions of the problem until you solve the original, larger problem. A method or function is recursive if it can call itself. When we call this function with a positive integer, it will recursively call itself by decreasing the number. Each function multiplies the number with the factorial of the number below it until it is equal to one. Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. It is especially good for working on things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach. One good example of this would be searching through a file system. Recursion is a programming term that means calling a function from itself. Recursive functions can be used to solve tasks in elegant ways. When a function calls itself, that's called a recursion step. So how recursion works? It works through recursive function. Recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.\")"
